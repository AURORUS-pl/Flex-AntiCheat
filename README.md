Welcome to my project called Flex AntiCheat. In this project I optimize AntiCheats with more advanced configs.
My goal with Flex is to give AntiCheats less false positives and even try to prevent bugs, bypasses or even better detection!

Currently there is an [AAC](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/tree/master/AAC) and [Spartan](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/tree/master/Spartan) version available. Support for [AACAdditionPro](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/tree/master/AACAdditionPro) and [AntiAura](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/tree/master/AntiAura) is discontinued.

My config has some special features for every config and AntiCheat.

The AAC version has an improved config layout, better and easier to understand notes for the settings of every check, a lot of language errors fixed, ConditionalCommands support for TPS, Ping, uptime, playtime and false kicks protection and not to forget, optimized config values.

The Spartan version has an improved config layout, ConditionalCommands support for TPS, Ping, uptime, playtime and false kicks protection and not to forget, optimized config values.

There are a number of things required to use Flex as an AntiCheat on your server. If you do not stick to this, Flex will not work correctly and the consequences may be, hackers that bypass the checks or false positives.

If you want to use AAC as AntiCheat, you have to keep to the following:

1. The server must be in good condition to keep the TPS high. The minimum to avoid the false positives must always be higher than 19 (19.5 and higher is the best). When the TPS falls below 19.5, the detection will go slower to prevent further false positives.

2. Buy AAC [HERE](https://bit.ly/FlexAACSpigot).

3. (Recommended) Download ConditionalCommands [HERE](https://bit.ly/FlexConditionalCommands).

4. Copy the latest Flex build for AAC [HERE](https://bit.ly/FlexAAC4Latest) into the existing config of the AntiCheat. Also look at the spacing before run the config or you will get a error.

5. Always check the config before you use it on your server. Sometimes you do not want to use certain checks or things that have to do with ping or TPS detection. If you need further assistance you can always make a report [HERE](https://bit.ly/FlexReports) or use Discord [HERE](https://bit.ly/FlexDiscord).

If you want to use Spartan as AntiCheat, you have to keep to the following:

Helping me with reporting false positives, bugs or bypasses is awesome but understand this. This is a config and a config cant fix everything. Most of the time when you found a false positive has noting to do with my Flex config. So before you report a issue, try it with the default config. If you dont have the false positive, bug or bypass with the default config but only with my Flex config then you can report it [HERE](https://bit.ly/FlexReports) or use Discord [HERE](https://bit.ly/FlexDiscord).
